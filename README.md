This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab focused on cryptography and encrypting and decrypting files.  We first used HashCalc, MD5 calculator, HashMyFiles, BCTextEncoder to encrypt various sets of information. The second task we had to do was create a self-signed certificate. The third task was we used RMail to perform email encryption. The fourth task was performing disk encryption using VeraCrypt, BitLocker Drive Encryption. Our last task was to perform cryptanalysis using CrypTool and AlphaPeeler. This lab was overall fairly easy and mainly consisted just using tools through windows and not requiring any coding.
