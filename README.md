This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab focused on cryptography and encrypting and decrypting files. I first used HashCalc, MD5 calculator, HashMyFiles, BCTextEncoder to encrypt various sets of information. The second task I had to do was create a self-signed certificate. The third task was we used RMail to perform email encryption. The fourth task was performing disk encryption using VeraCrypt, BitLocker Drive Encryption. I then performed cryptanalysis using CrypTool and AlphaPeeler. This lab was overall fairly easy and mainly consisted just using tools through windows and not requiring any coding.
